# unlock-caps
This is the repo of the MVP application that we, a team of four, built for a local Austin startup over the course of four weeks: KeyUp Austin.
This application serves as a way to connect lower-income students with middle-class career paths and training services to receive
the necessary certifications.

Team Members:
- [Brian Hickey](https://github.com/bphicke)
- [Elyse Vest](https://github.com/evest90)
- [Mason Hunter](https://github.com/Hunterist12)
- [Nicole Nguyen](https://github.com/nicole-nguyen1)

## Motivation
When trying to decide what we wanted to work on for our thesis project at Hack Reactor, our instructor pitched KeyUp's need and product
to us. We jumped at the opportunity to build their MVP because it would give us real-world experience working with designers. On top of that,
we knew that the app would actually be used by people - KeyUp's plan is to get this in the hands of 20,000 users in 2019.

## Demo
- We deployed KeyUp's application [here on their domain](http://keyup.services).

## Tech Stack
Built with
- Front-End: React, Redux, Material UI
- Back-End: Node, Express, GraphQL
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Features
- View careers and training services
- Sign in and create account (Passport local strategy authentication with GraphQL and JSON web tokens)
- Favorite careers and training services

Future features entail:
- Facebook and Google OAuth

- Dynamic, multi-page questionnaire intake form
- Internal tool for KeyUp admins and trusted partner organizations to edit database information
