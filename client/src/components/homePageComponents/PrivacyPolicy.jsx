              Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted 
              and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address

              billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers 
              in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
